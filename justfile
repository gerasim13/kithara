# and are read off it: the line from the pins, the prefix from where `brew`
# itself sits. Nothing here runs the package manager, because `just` evaluates
# every variable before it knows which recipe was asked for, so this is on the
# clock of every invocation including the nested ones a test drives. A keg the
# machine does not have leaves this empty and its own search path stands alone.
# `xtask` cannot own this: it is itself a cargo build that would need the answer

# Linux container has none: GitHub answered its anonymous request with a
