//! Heap measurement for tests: a global allocator that counts what it hands
//! out, so a test can charge a budget to the subsystem that spent it.
//!
//! A test binary installs it once at its root:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[global_allocator]
//! static HEAP: kithara_test_utils::memory::Counting = kithara_test_utils::memory::Counting;
//! ```
//!
//! and then reads [`live_bytes`] around the construction it is measuring.
//! [`measure`] wraps that pattern: it returns what the value it built holds,
//! so a suite can name one line per subsystem instead of one total.
