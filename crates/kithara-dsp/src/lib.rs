//! Allocation-free, panic-free vector DSP over planar `f32`, without implicit
//! sanitization. Layout kernels match `fast_interleave`; strided channel-major
//! operations need no plane-reference slices. Apple uses Accelerate; other targets
//! select `fearless_simd` by CPU capability. `filter` supplies denormal-safe biquads,
//! `interp` supplies fractional sampling and rate ramps, and feature-gated
//! `spectrum` supplies Hann-windowed real FFT, bin magnitude/phase and
//! autocorrelation. `sum_squares` reduces energy; `downmix` averages channels.
