# kithara-host

`kithara-host` owns Kithara's multi-player session, shared Firewheel output
graph, session transport, and platform audio backend. A player/deck remains in
`kithara-play`; beat-grid and synchronization contracts remain in
`kithara-warp`.

Callers fully construct a player or decorator and transfer that instance with
`Host::insert`. The Host attaches its opaque session capability exactly once
and retains the instance; callers receive a typed `HostOwned` control endpoint,
not the player value or its session dispatcher.

`Host<S>` shares the player's closed buffer-pool schema. Insertion accepts only
players with that same schema, while each registered deck retains its existing
`PoolRegion<S>` handle for graph-node scratch allocation.

`HostConfig<S>` directly selects and configures a realtime or offline session.
With the `offline` feature, the same `Host<S>` drives its owned graph without an
audio device and implements `kithara_output::OfflineRenderer` for exact finite
output-frame ranges. Its offline variant carries the pool, render quantum,
latency, worker, task, dispatcher, and optional probe pacing budgets.

The current crate is a mechanical ownership extraction. Runtime invariants and
dependency boundaries are documented in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md).
