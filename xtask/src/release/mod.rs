//! The release flow. CI builds every artifact once, then publishing runs the
//! channel's steps over those bytes: the tag step stamps the Swift manifest
//! and the changelog on a commit beside the branch and tags it on both
//! remotes; the release step publishes that tag with its changelog section on
//! GitHub and `GitLab`; the Pages step lays the demo, the documentation, the
//! archives, and the crates out as the project site. The nightly channel
//! replaces one rolling release with what the branch built today.
