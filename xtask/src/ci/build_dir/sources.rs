//! A build directory follows one checkout, and Cargo calls a path package's
//! unit fresh while no file it read is newer than the unit's build. The
//! checkout's mtimes say when git last wrote each file, so a branch checked
//! out in between leaves every file it touched newer than every build, though
//! the file holds again what the directory built from: each job built again
//! whatever the previous job's branch differed in.
//!
//! The directory therefore records the content its builds read, file by file,
//! with the mtime a claim gave that content. A claim gives each file whose
//! content the record names that mtime back and every other file the time of
//! the claim, so Cargo builds what changed since this directory's own builds,
//! whatever ran in the checkout between them. A build script that watches a
//! directory reruns by the newest mtime below it, the directories' own
//! included, and git moves a directory whenever it writes a file into it, so
//! a directory reads as new as the newest file it holds, or as the claim when
//! a file the record names has left it. Those mtimes are older than the
//! ones git wrote, so every build directory of a CI checkout claims before it
//! builds: one that did not would judge a file by a time another directory's
//! record gave it. A settled claim gives them back, so the checkout reads as
//! git wrote it to whatever builds there after the job.
//!
//! The record speaks for the directory while its builds read what the claim
//! stamped. A job that never settled its claim may have built from content it
//! wrote itself, and a build after the record was settled went through no
//! claim at all; either leaves artifacts of unknown content, and the next
//! claim stamps every file.
